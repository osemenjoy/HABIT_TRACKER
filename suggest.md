Here’s a breakdown of the suggestions in simpler terms:  

1. **Store habit events instead of just aggregated data:**  
   - Right now, you might be thinking of storing only summary data like "Current Streak: 5 days" or "Total Completions: 20".  
   - Instead, consider saving **each completion event** (e.g., every time a user marks a habit as completed, store the date).  
   - This way, you can **dynamically calculate streaks and totals** rather than relying on pre-saved numbers, which can be limiting if users need more detailed insights later.  

2. **Plan for testing early:**  
   - Before coding too much, think about **how you’ll test your features** to make sure they work correctly.  
   - Write tests for your **models (database structure) and views (how pages interact with users)** to check that habits are stored, retrieved, and updated properly.  
   - Example: A test could verify that when a user completes a habit today, it gets saved correctly and isn’t duplicated.  

3. **Use predefined habit data for testing:**  
   - Instead of creating habits manually every time you test, add **pre-set sample data** (e.g., a habit like “Drink Water” that already has some completions).  
   - This helps you check how analytics and streak calculations work **without needing to create new habits from scratch each time**.  

### Why is this important?  
If you only store streaks as a number, you **lose historical data** (e.g., if a user wants to see how their habits changed over time). By storing each habit completion separately, you can **recalculate streaks and trends anytime**, giving users more flexibility.

## Final Submission Suggestion
Thanks for your submission, looks very good on paper! For the final phase, make sure you check the following boxes:

-✅ Ensure your project is uploaded to GitHub and polished. Avoid committing unnecessary files such as pycache by using a .gitignore file.
- ✅ Adhere to basic Python naming conventions for readability.
- ✅ Structure your code in a modular fashion with logically split files to enhance user understanding.
- ✅ Provide thorough code comments and documentation for easier navigation and comprehension of your code base.
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for habit management (creation, editing, deletion) and for functionalities in the analytics module, ensuring all core features work as intended with predefined habit data.
- ✅ In the Readme file, give clear instructions on how to run your project and a summary of the project features.
